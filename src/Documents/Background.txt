I am a game programmer based in the UK, with a foundation in game development cultivated during my time at college ( Colchester Institute ). Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor's degree ( BA ) in game development programming at Falmouth University.  
Proficient in both Unreal Engine ( Blueprint and C++ ) and Unity Game Engine ( C# ), I have actively contributed my skills to numerous projects over the years of study. These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set and invaluable insights, ultimately enhancing my capabilities as a developer. I firmly believe that my knowledge and dedication make me an ideal candidate for any opportunity in the field.
