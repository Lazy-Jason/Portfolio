In this project, I aimed to recreate the intricate dodging mechanics and diverse attack patterns of the boss, including her distinctive ability to regenerate health after successfully landing hits on the player. Several elements were incorporated to emulate the intensity of a boss fight, such as an additional stage with unique spells wielded by the boss, the integration of mini cutscenes to depict the entrance and transition to the second stage of the battle, the introduction of Ash of War for the player, a combat combo system, and a leveling system.

Importantly, these skills were designed for easy addition and removal without disrupting the underlying code structure.",
                "I also ventured into optimization within Unreal Engine, as it was crucial to maintain a steady frame rate of 60fps, or around 35-40fps on the computers at the Game Academy within the university. Employing cost-effective techniques, such as disabling contact shadows on numerous lights and meticulously removing assets unseen by the player along their intended path to the boss, became essential. Additionally, I implemented strategies like generating LOD (Level of Detail) for all meshes used in the level to enhance performance. Among the most impactful solutions was minimizing the number of lights present in the scene and reducing their attenuation radius to prevent overlapping light sources. Furthermore, including a settings menu proved pivotal, recognizing that not all players could achieve optimal performance. This feature allowed users to customize various video and other settings to align with their system requirements."
